## A customer writes in to the Helpdesk asking "How do I do a redirect from the `/blog` path to "https://example.com?". Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Hello Customer,

Thanks for reaching out, I'm happy to help! Just to quickly confirm, are you using a framework? And if so, which one? I’m happy to provide you further detailed guidance.

Here’s a quick example using Next.js:

Within your `next.config.js` file, you can use the `redirects` key. You’ll want to specify the required `source`, `destination`, and `permanent` properties.

This should look something like this:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog",
        destination: "https://example.com",
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Here’s our page on [using redirects with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects)

You can also configure redirects regardless of the framework. These redirects can be either dynamic or static. For more information, please see [this page](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#redirects).

Please let me know if you have any additional questions!

Best,

Michael

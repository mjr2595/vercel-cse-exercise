Solving interesting problems is my biggest motivator at work. I’ve been doing technical support and solving technical problems for a while now and continue to remain engaged and eager to learn more. Luckily, there is always more to learn! Lately, I’ve been having a blast learning more and more about web technologies and web development. Being able to create something that solves a problem is highly rewarding. I want to continue expanding my knowledge in web development, across the entire stack, including CI/CD and other tooling.

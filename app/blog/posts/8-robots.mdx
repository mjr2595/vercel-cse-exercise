## A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply.

Hello Customer,

Thanks for reaching out, I'm happy to help! Just to quickly confirm, are you using a framework? And if so, which one? Are you looking to not index all deployments, including Production deployments?

Indexing, by default, is handled via the X-Robots-Tag Header. From our Vercel [guide on indexing](https://vercel.com/guides/are-vercel-preview-deployment-indexed-by-search-engines):

> Vercel [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview) are **not indexed by search engines** by default because the **`X-Robots-Tag`** HTTP header is set to `noindex`. If you are using a [Custom Domain](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains) that is assigned to a non-[Production Branch](https://vercel.com/docs/git#production-branch), however, the header `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` **will not** be set.

That said, you can add or generate a `robots.txt` file. For example, if using Next.js with App Router:

`app/robots.txt`

```jsx
User-agent: *
Disallow: /

Sitemap: https://acme.com/sitemap.xml
```

or, dynamically:

`app/robots.ts`

```jsx
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: {
      userAgent: "*",
      disallow: "/",
    },
    sitemap: "https://acme.com/sitemap.xml",
  };
}
```

More info can be found on [this page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots).

Please let me know if you have any additional questions!

Best,

Michael

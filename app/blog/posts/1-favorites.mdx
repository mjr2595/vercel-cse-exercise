From [this](https://gist.github.com/Pieparker/b04a4e9ff82ba949e5db9d5b0e9d89e8) list, rank your 5 most favourite and 5 least favourite support tasks. Provide a
brief explanation for each.

## 5 Most Favourite Support Tasks

1. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub

   - I love breaking things! I also love fixing things! I like testing edge cases and poking holes in things. On top of that, the thing I find most rewarding is actually figuring out what’s causing the issue and how to fix it.

2. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers

   - I do this currently with my current role, and it’s super fun and rewarding to take user feedback and help drive product improvements.

3. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project

   - It’s like finding a needle in a haystack, only it’s logs and if I find the error(s) I can better understand the issue and get it all fixed up!

4. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case

   - While currently my video editing skill are novice at best, I do love the idea of helping and teaching in fun ways. Video tutorials can definitely be both fun and educational!

5. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use

   - This is honestly something I wish my past employers would focus on more. Finding and surfacing these trends is so beneficial. This data can then be used to drive product improvements which is always great. This also sounds like it could involve some internal tooling development which is something I would love to contribute to.

## 5 Least Favourite Support Tasks

1. Help resolve billing issues for customers

   - Billing issues can be a real big pain for customers, and while super important, these types of issues are simply not the most fun for me due to them usually being less technical.

2. Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team

   - This is very important, and something I’ve certainly done in current and previous roles, but it’s more of a means to an end than a fun and interesting task.

3. Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case

   - This may be more fun than it sounds honestly. I’m just placing it here because it sounds a tad bit sales-y and sales stuff isn’t my forte.

4. Manage a support team

   - Management is actually something I am wanting to explore and get into; however, I’m thinking this is something I’d prefer to explore at a later time.

5. Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites

   - This can either be super fun or super stressful. Since it’s a toss-up, I’m going to assume the worst and say it’s not one of my favorites. Really it’s just getting more difficult to add to this list!

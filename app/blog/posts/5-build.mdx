## Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

If I haven’t heard of the framework or technology, and don’t have a basic understanding of it, I would first spend a little time researching and gathering a general feel for how it works. The first step of troubleshooting is always information gathering, so once I gather that base information I would next see what all information has been provided by the customer and what additional info might they be able to provide in order to better guide next steps.

My response might look like this:

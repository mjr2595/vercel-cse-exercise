This was honestly one of my favorite take home exercises I’ve had.
I love the idea of demonstrating that I can deploy to Vercel, while simultaneously answer questions to better provide a picture of what all I can offer to the team.
I also tried to have as much fun as possible. Building things online should be fun!
My only "feedback" is to include some “obviously bad” support tasks to the list in question 1. Choosing 5 favorites and 5 least favorite things ended up being more difficult than I had anticipated due most of the choices being pretty cool.
Now if talking about my submission, I would improve a couple things if I had more time.
I would like to clean up more of the 'blog' parts of the site -- for example, the 'blog' path being changed to 'answers'. I would also like to figure out why my markdown blockquotes aren't rendering properly.

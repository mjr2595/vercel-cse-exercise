## What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

From what I can see online, common questions are generally regarding build errors, deployment issues, and Next.js guidance and issues. For short-term solutions, I would focus on providing workarounds and guidance. This could be on a ticket-by-ticket basis or within Vercelâ€™s Github discussion boards. Longterm, I would work internally with various teams to ensure visibility and help develop solutions to these problems while providing a voice for our customers. Luckily, Vercel is very open about feedback, so this will make things a easier!
